# `reol`

[![Travis build status](https://travis-ci.org/richelbilderbeek/reol.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/richelbilderbeek/reol)

Contemporary version of the `Reol` package.
The original version of `Reol` was written by
Barb Banbury and Brian O'Meara and can be found 
[here](https://r-forge.r-project.org/R/?group_id=1523).
This package `reol` (note the lowercase R) 
started from the last submitted CRAN source 
[here (which is version 1.55)](https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/Reol/Reol_1.55.tar.gz).

I could find the original maintainer, but not her email address. Due to that,
I took off without any form of communication with the original maintainer.
I just hope she's OK with that. As I keep using the same license, there
should be no problem.

`reol` does not intend to be backwards compatible at with `Reol`.
To prevent version conflicts, `reol`'s first version is `v2.0`.
