# reol

GitHub mirror/copy of the `Reol` package. 

The original/true version of Reol can be found [here](https://r-forge.r-project.org/R/?group_id=1523).

I downloaded the last submitted CRAN source 
[here](https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/Reol/Reol_1.55.tar.gz),
which is version 1.55.
